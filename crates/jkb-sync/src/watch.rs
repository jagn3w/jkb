//! Filesystem watch mode: react to changes under a mount and reconcile, debouncing
//! bursts of events (editors save via several syscalls) so one logical edit triggers
//! one reconcile. This is the only async/blocking edge in `jkb-sync`.
//!
//! Events carry the paths that changed, so a burst reconciles just those files via
//! [`crate::sync_paths`] rather than re-scanning the whole mount — important once a
//! mount backs a large tree. Only two situations fall back to a full [`crate::sync`]:
//! the initial reconcile on startup (to catch drift from while the watcher was off),
//! and a watcher error or dropped-events signal (`need_rescan`), where we can no
//! longer trust the incremental path list.
//!
//! Stopping is via a shared `Arc<AtomicBool>` flag (checked each idle tick), so one
//! signal (e.g. the CLI's Ctrl-C handler) can stop a single [`watch`] or the
//! all-mounts [`watch_all`] uniformly.
